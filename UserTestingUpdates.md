# User Testing Results (19th April)

### Main Feedback
- Since the fireballs were launching out of the headset, it didn't feel right for the user. 
  - Possible Solutions 
    - Give some sort of cue to the user to align themselves to punch where they look (not that good)
    - Vector mapping - map the start and end of the punch and launch the fireball in that direction (good)
- What would happen with other players in the game would be interesting
- Good to have some visual feedback or indicator of the game telling you if you are doing well
  - Solution: Add a UI for health, stamina
- It is a very steep learning curve on gestures
  - Solution: Add the gesture tutorials
- Might be better to simplify to a single controller
  - Right now, that is what we are going to do. We also plan on making another controller available to shoot fireballs from both hands as a possible skill stone
- More feedback and a storyline is needed for the user to understand the purpose of the game. This is especially necessary for those users who haven't seen or heard of Avatar previously

### New Ideas and moving forward
- Apart from the solutions proposed to the user testing feedback
  - Have a series of islands, connected by bridges / seperated by gates, and each island would have a skill stone in the middle of it
  - Have an open world where you would need to cross many gates in order to reach your final destiantion. Each gate cross would require a new skill set. Final reward would be a sunset tea with Iroh (a wise character in the original show)
