**Project Name**: Avatar: The Last Airbender  
**Group members**: Faizan, Navya and Tavius  
**Technical Specifications**: [Technical Specifications](https://github.com/navyasuri/PUNtrial/blob/master/TechnicalSpecifications.md)

## Project Overview

**Describe what your project is about**. Describe what kind of experience you intend to offer the audience, what drives you to make it, and what you think is interesting about it. This is the part of the document where you must capture the attention of your reader, so try to be as interesting and concise as possible.  

Water, Earth, Fire, Air. If you could summon any one of these core elements, which would you choose? Our virtual reality experience of Avatar: The Last Airbender puts the power of the elements in the hands of the player. By honing their skills on a unique set of movement gestures sourced from the hit TV series, players will materialize fireballs, launch powerful gusts of wind, and pull boulders from the ground beneath their feet—all with their very own hands. At a time when popular media is all about pushing the edge of the possible, our experience provides the agency to tap into the supernatural powers within oneself.


**Describe why this project is relevant to its medium**. What is it about VR that will make it different than on a 2D screen, or as a physical performance? This is where you show the reader that you not only have a great idea, but that you also understand the technical aspects of the medium you're working in. Make sure you also mention why this is important as a social experience.  

Without virtual reality, the experience of controlling the elements would be no different from pushing a button and watching the results. Informed and refined by players themselves, our 1-to-1 gesture recognition system flips that model of interaction entirely. The player must be physically involved to make the magic happen, their actions reinforced by haptic feedback. The only piece we’ll be missing by the end is the heat of the flames. This level of immersion is what allows the experience to flow naturally, placing the users within the world of Avatar. Players are then opened up to new interactions, reshaping the world around them, acting instinctively to defend themselves if an attack is headed their way, or simply having fun with their newfound abilities.
  
A core plot device of Avatar is progressing through shared knowledge, seeking out masters of the elements to learn how to control the forces of nature firsthand. Anyone familiar with virtual reality should know the moment when somebody passes the headset over with a, “Check this out.” There will be no watching for awe from the sidelines here. As a multiplayer experience the barrier of switching the headset is dropped; friends can show each other newly discovered gestures from within the world.


**Describe the emotion that you want to suggest in your audience**. Why would anyone want to experience your particular project, and what would they get out of it? Do they learn/reflect/play/challenge? Include how you will achieve that goal through interaction design and spatial design.  

Based on how an individual decides to partake in the world, the experience will take on personal characteristics. Do they exhaust the resources of the environment by burning everything for fun? Maybe they figure out a means to fly by manipulating a rock in the right way. Will friends team up to defend against the harsher aspects of the environment of will they duel to the death? In general, we feel that people will get a sense of excitement and awe in controlling these elemental superpowers to interact with their friends and the environment. Ambient—though not necessarily passive—aspects of the surroundings reinforce the idea of elements as forces of nature. The players will interact with these sources of energy by either utilizing them to power up (by grabbing a fireball that jumps from a pool of lava) or fending them off (cooling that pool of lava into traversable ground).

The game is meant to be a challenge, as well as a learning opportunity. The learning happens with players making sense of their environment, harnessing its power and coming to a better understanding of the capabilities of their chosen element to use it more naturally. Ideally the user finds a flow in using gestures as the interaction input, promoting a feeling of in sync with their element. Given an initial set of gestures, the players gain agency through the discovery and sharing of new gestures, building a more complex set of moves. Competing for master of an element is what will drive players towards the conclusion of the experience. This method of experiential learning becomes a challenge in combat when that learning happens while on your toes.

The idea is give a sense of this lived-in world, where the knowledge of the elements steeped in ancient history. Players find themselves in an arena where the greatest warriors have trained. Mountains in the distance are cracked in half from epic battles, scorch marks are left from prior streams of fire, an aimless whirlwind tosses objects around. The play space can be ‘damaged’ or otherwise changed by the players. When a boulder is pulled from the ground a crater appears. If thrown at a stone column, the column will break and fall, offering new material to bend with.


**Are there any unusual aspects?** Something that other projects in the same field don't have to take care of, but that you're experimenting with for the first time? Additional libraries, custom controllers, specific layout of the room in which the project will be presented, etc. This part is meant to show that you are not afraid to push boundaries of what exists, but that you are also aware of what you are doing.  

The 1-to-1 gesture input system, powered by AirSig, is our core game mechanic. Players will be able to ‘draw’ certain patterns using the motion of the controllers, and these patterns get translated into elemental results. All elements will have a basic gesture set of drawing a line outwards from the body and drawing a circle in front of the body, to launch a attack and raise a shield of the selected element in the direction the player is looking towards. To maintain a sense of grounding in the world, we will be using touchpad input to move greater distances within the space than the room-scale setup alone would provide, without breaking the feel of the game with jumping teleports. This is something other duel-style element or wizard battle games have not come out with yet, so far these games keep the players locked at fixed distances from each other, constraining a potentially awesome VR experience into more limitation than necessary with the current technology. Scattered within the environment will be hints to unlocking the undiscovered gestures, but finding these is in no way a prerequisite to discovering the patterns on one’s own.


## Design Overview

**Describe the fictional context of your project**. Once the user lands in your world, where is she (e.g. nature, laboratory, bedroom, someone's mind?). What is the backstory of that virtual place, and what is the role of the user in that story? In addition to a concise backstory for the environment itself, you can also add one for the user herself. How do you use patterns, and cognitive maps to convey an idea?

The players will navigate an outdoor landscape representative of the natural world. The starting locations for users will vary to contain features of their chosen element, being fire, water, earth, or water. As an example, players who choose to be waterbenders could be positioned next to a lake. Aside from the natural sprawl, which could be procedurally generated for an engaging sandbox experience, the environment will feature two “arenas.” One will be a battle to the top of a volcano, where the players must combine their skills to navigate the hazards of lava flows, fire geysers, and molten boulders. The other will be a space for structured duels, as evidenced by the traces of battle left behind. The skill-stones will be designed with a unique prefab to tip off players to their significance, as well as potentially having a subtle audio track associated with their proximity to guide players closer. The popularity of Avatar is on our side, and a number of assets have already been designed around the universe. Distributing these as key landmarks within the world will help guide as well.

**Describe the core interaction(s) of your project**. Why does the audience want to do that interaction? What is it interacting with? Why is it meaningful? How are you indicating it to them? What are the specific, detailed steps that the audience takes for the interaction to initiate and complete? What is the consequence of the interaction? How do you ensure that your interaction can be performed over and over and over without getting boring?

The core interaction is the ability to manipulate an element through certain gestures of the controller(s). After choosing their elements and entering the game, players will be informed at the beginning of the experience about some basic gestures/actions they can perform and the effect of those movements. As a basic example, a firebender player is on the offense with hands up, tenses on the grip of their controller to prime the attack (starting the gesture), then punches forwards drawing a line, completing the action by releasing (closing the gesture) to shoot a fireball provided that the attempted gesture was recognized with high enough accuracy. The airbender across from them draws a circle in front of their body, activating and releasing their grip from the top of the circle to shape the air into a shield successfully deflecting the attack. All elements will feature this gesture set of line and circle. From there, different elements can take on different characteristics. Earthbenders traditionally have more setup in their actions, raising a rock to float before themselves before launching it forwards. This encourages players to revisit the experience with a different chosen element to explore the various possibilities.

The reactive interactions involve the player and the environment. The player can manipulate the element(s) found in the environment, using them intentionally to power up or to change an aspect of the world, such as which way the lava flows downhill. If they’re not careful that lava may wind up starting a forest fire. Fire in moderation can also be light source. This cause-and-effect relationship between the players newfound abilities and nature, the true master of the elements, will keep players thinking.

**Describe the visual aesthetic of your project**. What is the overall style (realistic, surrealistic, 8-bit, low-poly, etc.), and how does that style relate to the emotion you want to create? Along with it, describe how you intend to produce that art style (which software -Rhino, Photoshop-, which assets -thingiverse, asset store- and anything else -texture shaders, camera effects, generative techniques-).

To provide players a suspension of disbelief, our project will take on a realistic style for the most part. The elements themselves, and perhaps the player characters, may be more toon styled. In part, this is homage to the cartoon animation of the series. This is also a strategic means of setting achievable goals within our timeline, since the player and elements assets will be the bulk of our custom development. Ideally, blending styles like this highlights the player-controlled elements themselves as the standout aspect of our game.

**Provide a moodboard that represents the atmosphere of your world**.

![Avatar Moodboard](Elemelons/TheProject/Assets/Moodboard/avatar-moodboard.png)

**Describe the sonic environment of your project**. What does the audience member hear? Group them in three overall categories: sound effects, interface sounds and music. What is their character (e.g. metallic, smooth, melodic, organic), and how does that character tie in to the overall experience you are trying to build? You should have specific examples.

The score from Avatar: The Last Airbender will be used throughout the project, especially during the intro screen to provide a rush of nostalgia to players who are familiar with the series, and a proper welcome for those who are less so. For intense sequences it will be appropriate to use the Agni Kai track. In the Avatar universe an Agni Kai battle is a traditional high-stakes duel between firebenders over one’s honor, the goal being to burn the opponent. Keeping with the natural theme, any menu selection should produce a shaker sound, or a soft strike on a piece of bamboo. The skill-stones will emit an enticing, shimmery chime sound. Dialing the elements themselves will be key, to provide the proper bass tones of a boulder coming to rest on distance ground, the sputtering hiss of lava snaking along the mountainside, the crackle and whoosh of a fireball narrowly missing a player’s face, and getting creative with the sloshing of water as it is spun through the air. High quality samples of these basic elemental sound effects are more available than Unity assets themselves, so even if our models don’t look realistic, they should sound it.

**Describe the interface of your project**. How does the audience member interact with your project? How does the interface of your project allows her to understand what is going on and how to manipulate the state of the world? You should include sketches/wireframes of what the different interface elements should look like (e.g. potential titles, buttons, sliders, knobs). You should at least include one interface for joining your world, from the lobby room.

Upon starting the game, the intro screen will run, playing selected clips from the TV series intro. The player points and clicks to enter the begin the game, where they’re taken to a character selection screen. Clicking on the available elemental symbols (see moodboard) will change the displayed avatar to that element’s avatar type. There will also be an option to choose gender. Continuing from there begins to load the player into the world, with an instructions screen displaying the basic gestures and features of the game. When the controller grip is pressed down to draw a gesture, particle effects of the player’s element will trail behind so they they can visually register the shape they trace.


## Experience Overview

**Describe the overall experience of the audience member**. How do they join? Where do they start? What would they typically do? How would they conclude their experience? Emphasize the important moments and the transition moments.

The experience is designed to scale for many players in the world at once, so the only limit on active players is the number of VR headsets available. Otherwise it is a fully participatory experience. The watches (or skips) the intro scene, selects the element of their bending ability, then is presented with an instructions screen detailing how to draw gestures with the basic two, and offering a few tips on how to interact with the ambient elements of the environment. It becomes an open world from there.

Depending on the player’s chosen element, they are placed in different locations around the world map, next to a source of their element to begin training with. The player can try to discover new gestures on their own through intuition or luck, or they can seek out other sources of knowledge. Skill-stones can be found, but they may not be for the player’s specialization. Perhaps they will come across a player of that type to pass their findings on. Players should want to explore the landmarks, where they can find ancient history of the world and stage scenic duels. Another common inclination is to climb: the volcano will be the highest landmark, and a challenge to reach the safety of the peak. Should a team manage, they will be rewarded with a view of all the land. Feeling satisfied, the player can exit the game through the Steam menu.

**Describe a specific moment**. Try to be as precise and thorough as possible. Where does the audience member look? How do they move? What is going on in their head? What is a realistic, almost scientific depiction of the scene? How does the system look like at that moment? How does it evolve? This should be able to show the reader that you care about details and that you are not only thinking in broad, abstract terms.

You and your firebender teammate are trying to summit the central volcano. No more than fifteen meters from the peak and lava pours down the entire face of the mountain, save the one channel being held open by the firebender behind you. They are locked in concentration, hands sweeping left-left-right, left-left-right. The advance is slow, but without errors you will both make it to the summit, to safety. Suddenly a massive ball of molten rock jumps up from behind the edge ahead, beginning to roll straight towards the channel. Remembering your earthbender training you plant your feet, focus your gaze on the approaching boulder, point your elbows out to either side and spin your clenched fists in circles around each other in an attempt to gain control of the deadly chunk of stone. The drums of the music beat faster with each turn, the rumble of the boulder drowns out the hiss of the lava. After three full revolutions you shoot your arms out to full extension on either side, ending posed in a “T” shape. But you lack mastery. The boulder does not split in half as intended. There’s no time left to try again—in desperation you reach to the earth and pull upwards with all your might, sliding a sheet of rock in front of the both of you. Without a line of sight up the mountain you both crouch down as the molten ball jumps the wall, and clears your firebender friend to continue rolling down below. Quickly, you focus once more and pull at the wall, pausing for just a beat, and send it flying up the remainder of the volcano. Your friend keeps the lava from filling in the gouge, as the music turns triumphant. With the path clear you both make a final sprint to the top, earning victory over nature this day.


## Conclusion

Avatar: The Last Airbender will be a contemporary take on a beloved classic. Utilizing the forefront of virtual reality technology, the 1-to-1 gesture recognition system provided by AirSig, and our additional codebase we will put the elements within reach.
Apart from being able to control elements, users would also be able to discover new ways to manipulate them to their advantage. The generative, open world design curates an experience such that no two users have the exact same experience. Each of them would have control over their elements and their own unique discoveries on the path to mastering the techniques of its use.

To give users a chance to experience their childhood dreams, the game features assets from the original series including some of the great soundtracks, similar movements (gestures), and environments (as much as possible). The design is focused on keeping the user grounded in-world to the extent that all interactions are mapped to natural motions, for example gripping the controllers to focus one’s energy then releasing it to send the element on its way, or the use of free movement instead of teleportation.

Filled with riveting moments equally as memorable as the original Avatar: The Last Airbender is a donation-based virtual reality milestone most certainly worth your contribution.
